or not given his her various family and economic data points Only of the total population in the data was guilty and hence it was extremely important that the ML model captures and learns such a small portion of the data A technique called oversampling with ensemble was used to train the model on imbalanced data I was able to get a score of more than on the online leader board which put me under top scores out of participants Chat bot for service desk Created a Chabot for IT service desk to answer FAQs and simple resolution to users queries Used a library called Chatterbot to train the bot on user conversation with a help desk agent Used Flask to develop an application that provides an UI for chat and handles the model internally Hosted and initiated the bot on an AWS EC Ubuntu instance Predicting if a company will bankrupt or not given its various financial data points This project included tasks like preprocessing the data handling missing data and outliers and finally having a brief understanding of the dataset Since understanding the data comes with domain knowledge I used a Machine Learning approach called feature importance with a Random Forest model to select only the relevant features in the dataset An accuracy metric called AUC ROC score was used to evaluate the performance of the model which essentially tell us how well separated our two classes are classes Bankrupt or Not Bankrupt I achieved a descent score of using this approach PROJECTS ON GITHUB https github com riteshk Designed and implemented Artificial Neural Network ANN model to predict if a user

risk model to predict HF in patients with stable coronary artery disease and preserved ejection fraction for elderly patients What We did Identify a study population with CAD and define patient stability Follow these CAD stable patients for years and monitor for CHF Develop a model to predict the CHF event for stable CAD patients These patients can be early detected and treated for efficient care and avoid CHF event Results Entire study has been done on EMR data model is trained on logistic regression and Random Forest Understand explain the results to reduce the false negative rate and feature importance Accuracey for the model after K fold validation and grid search Predictor Model for lumbar spine surgery Objective Identify patients with high likelihood of undergoing preference sensitive orthopedic surgery well in advance of the procedure Based on previously published definition of mechanical low back problems which describes ICD ICD codes for pain conditions originating in lumbar and sacral spine surgery What We did Identify a study population with lower back pain and study them to predict risk score for them to undergo lumber spine surgery in next months Identify the population as early as possible first months from first diagnosis of lower back pain to intervene Results Women are less likely to proceed with surgery Drugs NSAIDs and Narcotics Drugs taking people are more likely to proceed for surgery Treatment Pain Management Injections More likely Spinal stenosis and sciatica are more likely for surgery Follow up visits are more likely to proceed for surgery C Personal Health Device and Healthcare Cost Objective The primary objective of this study was to understand if there were any changes in health care costs and utilization after members were given a personal health device PHD Provided consulting services to drive out and determine the analytics and research questions to be asked and then performed the analysis and drew conclusions What We did The PHD team provided a list of members along with the date each member started using the device The SBA team linked these members to administrative claims For these members determined if there were any significant differences in health care cost and utilization before and after they began using their devices Four populations of data were analyzed members who used their devices for at least months months months and months Results Office visits increased for members who used the devices at least months and for those who used them at least months Total costs increased for members after they used the devices at least months The study then assessed how much the cost increases were due to members engaging proactively in their health care by seeking more preventative services after they started using their PHDs increase in the number of preventive visits for members who used their devices for at least months and a increase for the months population In addition the total cost of preventive visits increased after at least months of wearing the devices Conclusion These results suggest PHD usage is associated with members proactively using preventive health services Exploratory Analysis and Trends For Cancer Cancer cost trends Identify Cancer Diagnosed Medical Claims Primary Cancer Type for Each Individual Cancer Patient Cancer Patients may develop to multiple cancers as their
