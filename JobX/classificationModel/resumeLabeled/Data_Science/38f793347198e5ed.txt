Analytics and Modeling  
Congestive heart failure (CHF) Risk Prediction utilizing EHR/EMR- Machine
Learning  
  
Objective:  
Development of a risk model to predict HF in patients with stable coronary
artery disease and preserved ejection fraction for elderly patients.  
  
What We did: Identify a study population with CAD and define patient
stability. Follow these CAD stable patients for 5 years and monitor for CHF
.Develop a model to predict the CHF event for stable CAD patients .These
patients can be early detected and treated for efficient care and avoid CHF
event.  
  
Results -  
Entire study has been done on EMR data model is trained on logistic regression
and Random Forest .Understand explain the results to reduce the false negative
rate and feature importance.Accuracey for the model after K fold validation
and grid search -.76.  
  
Predictor Model for lumbar spine surgery  
Objective:  
Identify patients with high likelihood of undergoing preference-sensitive
orthopedic surgery well in advance of the procedure.  
Based on previously published definition of mechanical low back problems,
which describes ICD-9/ICD10 codes for pain conditions originating in lumbar
and sacral spine surgery.  
  
What We did: Identify a study population with lower back pain and study them
to predict risk score for them to undergo lumber spine surgery in next 36
months. Identify the population as early as possible (first 2 months) from
first diagnosis of lower back pain to intervene.  
  
Results -  
Women are less likely to proceed with surgery  
Drugs-NSAIDs and Narcotics Drugs taking people are more likely to proceed for
surgery  
Treatment- Pain Management Injections More likely  
Spinal stenosis and sciatica are more likely for surgery  
Follow up visits are more likely to proceed for surgery  
C=0.73  
  
Personal Health Device and Healthcare Cost  
  
Objective:  
The primary objective of this study was to understand if there were any
changes in health care costs and utilization after members were given a
personal health device (PHD).  
Provided consulting services to drive out and determine the analytics and
research questions to be asked, and then performed the analysis and drew
conclusions.  
What We did:  
  
The PHD team provided a list of members along with the date each member
started using the device. The SBA team linked these members to administrative
claims.  
For these members, determined if there were any significant differences in
health care cost and utilization before and after they began using their
devices.  
Four populations of data were analyzed: members who used their devices for at
least 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months.  
  
Results:  
Office visits increased 7% for members who used the devices at least 9 months,
and 10% for those who used them at least 12 months. Total costs increased 21%
for members after they used the devices at least 12 months.  
The study then assessed how much the cost increases were due to members
engaging proactively in their health care by seeking more preventative
services after they started using their PHDs.  
14% increase in the number of preventive visits for members who used their
devices for at least 9 months, and a 12% increase for the >12 months
population. In addition, the total cost of preventive visits increased 12%
after at least 9 months of wearing the devices.  
Conclusion:  
These results suggest PHD usage is associated with members proactively using
preventive health services.  
  
Exploratory Analysis and Trends For Cancer  
Cancer cost trends  
  
➢ Identify Cancer Diagnosed Medical Claims  
  
➢ Primary Cancer Type for Each Individual Cancer Patient:-  
Cancer Patients may develop to multiple cancers as their conditions progress.
A primary cancer is  
flagged for the purpose of analytics and metrics calculation.  
  
A primary cancer type is defined as the cancer type with the highest cancer
costs in a given time  
period (study time period or trend time period)  
  
➢ Identify Actively Treated Cancer Patients: Generate evidence that actively
treated cancer patients, who accounts for only 20% of overall cancer
population spends 80% of overall cancer related costs.  
  
➢ Understand cost involved with chemo, radiation and surgery.  
➢ Prevalence of cancer within Medicare and commercial population  
➢ Trends in overall cost and average cost across cancer category.  
  
Research Projects /Feasibility  
2\. A Research study For Epidemiology(Oct14)  
  
➢ Counts of atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients
using warfarin or novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC).  
➢ Find number of patients with AF or VTE.  
➢ Find number of patients with AF/VTE who have also used warfarin or NOACs in
the 6-months following first diagnosis of AF/VTE.  
➢ Estimate average follow-up. Calculate follow-up time as day after index date
through the earliest of end of enrollment or 31-DEC-2013.  
➢ Find number of patients with more than 3 years of follow-up.  
➢ Find numbers by ethnicity/race.  
➢ Identify women who have delivered an infant during follow-up.  
➢ Infant must be matched by family ID and enrolled in health plan.  
Infant will be "assigned" to same cohort as mother.  
  
➢ For Commercial members only, find number of enrolled infants who can be
linked to women in this cohort  
  
Enterprise wise Dashboards  
  
5\. Prepare Oncology Management Sell Sheet(May13)  
  
➢ Oncology data for four of the five cancer type  
Out of five cancer type prostate cancer have different wave of collection.  
Both wave of collection should be merged and then combined with enrollment  
Data to update the OM Sheet.  
  
Request is to update:  
➢ Oncology Database Population by Cancer Type  
➢ Stage distribution for each type of Cancer Type  
➢ Histology for each type of Cancer Type  
➢ Most Recent Clinical Status for each type of Cancer Type  
  
6\. Enterprise wise chart book ( Bi Yearly dashboard)  
  
A comprehensive chart book or dashboard for the entire united data for our
internal and external customers. This is specifically designed for HEOR and
EPI customers. This gives a comprehensive view of about 160m of claim ,
clinical and other linkages that we work on to perform our study and which is
available to researchers, Includes,

GALAXY PURGE ARCHIVE  
The two main deliverables of the GALAXY Purge/Archive project was to:  
1\. Purge data from the live database to allow for loading of current data  
2\. Provide the GALAXY user community with archived data.  
  
Decisions on whether or not to purge particular records depend upon rules
specific to each subject area. The initial decision, however, is always based
upon a purge cutoff date (e.g., qualifying records where a date field is equal
to or earlier than a target date). The actual date field in use varies for
certain subject areas  
The project consists of separate purge and archive processes Tables subject to
purge/archive are those included in these subject areas:  
  
• UNet Claim Statistical  
• UNet Aggregations  
• COSMOS Claim Statistical  
• COSMOS Aggregations  
• UNet Claim Financial  
• Pharmacy  
• Lab Results

tables affected by the project across different subject areas within GALAXY.  
2\. To provide sign-off for the coding, unit testing and system testing for
UNIX and mainframe side to meet with Functional specification.  
  
3\. To analyze the changes happening in the data warehouse for last two
quarter and its impact on purge and archive process.  
4\. To track and provide any business issues interacting with business and
testing team.  
5.Coordinate internally with development team, designers and business forum to
