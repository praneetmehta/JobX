February 2018 to Present

Mumbai, India [ AI Product Development] Feb 2018 - Present  
  
• Developed an Artificial Intelligence - Autonomous System(for cybersecurity)
to help maintain compliance with minimal human intervention.[Singlehandedly]  
  
• Utilized Deep learning(Neural Networks) in Tensorflow combined with NLP to
build probabilistic language model to process GBs of unstructured text data.  
• Worked on concepts like Vector space(embeddings), text classification, topic
modeling, clustering, Ensemble ML as sub-projects.Code in production phase..

LSTM Neural Networks

-

December 2017 to February 2018

• LSTM built using the Keras library to predict time series steps and
sequences for emerging trends.Tested for different epoch values for both
datasets.  
• Used n-sized window of training/testing data and normalized each to reflect
percentage changes to deal with the highly fluctuating patterns of stock data.

Twitter Sentiment Analysis (Experimentation)

-

October 2017 to December 2017

• Use of different feature sets and machine learning classifiers to determine
the best combination for sentiment analysis of tweets data.  
• Experiment with various pre-processing steps using NLTK and investigated the
following features - unigrams, bigrams, trigrams and negation detection.  
• Trained the classifier using various machine-learning algorithms - Naive
Bayes, Decision Trees and Maximum Entropy.

Kaggle Consumer Finance Datasets

-

August 2017 to October 2017

Grid Embeddings (word2vec) and over-fitting and attaining lower in Tensorflow
for multi-label text classification for consumer complaints dataset.  
• Used Wordsearch and boosting to reduceConvolutional Neural Networks RMSE.  
• Uses an embedding layer, followed by a convolutional, max-pooling and
softmax.Visualized results on Tensorboard - graph and embedding visualizer.
