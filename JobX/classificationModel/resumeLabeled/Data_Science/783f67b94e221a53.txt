HDCHN - (Honour Diploma in Computer  
Language: Python - Logistics Regression  
Hardware and Networking) at Faast Track  
Description: The objective is to identify Customer Churn Computer Education,
Madurai -Jul '2009  
(customers having high probability of discontinuing from the DCA - Diploma in
Computer Application at  
service) now or in future based on existing data. It also involves Faast Track

understanding the factors that drives them to their decisions so Nov '2009  
proper remedial measures can be done to retain such  
customers. Personal Info  
Responsibilities:  
Full Name: Raajesh Babu Kuppa Moorthy  
• Model was built to predict customers who have are more likely Father's name:
Moorthy K H  
to churn out  
• Transformed continuous variable using custom logic into  
meaningful factor variable will improve the model  
  
performance and help understand the insights of the  
  
data  
• Performed univariate and bivariate analysis to Languages: Tamil, English and
Sourashtra.  
understand the distribution of the variable and find out Permanent address: 2,
School lane, South  
significant variable for further analysis Krishnan kovil street, […] Performed
Logistic Regression Analysis  
• Validated the model using various test like Multicollinearity,  
Concordance, Confusion matrix.  
  
Project Title: Customer Segmentation  
Language: Python - K-Means Clustering  
  
Description: A survey was done to study the consumer  
segmentation based on theirs spending preference in a Mall.  
We have questionnaire pointing out spending score based on  
ratings ranging from 1 to 100 which would provide the  
information on consumer buying preference in a Mall.  
  
Responsibilities: -  
  
• Used Cluster Analysis where made used of K-Means Cluster  
Analysis  
• Using Elbow curve found out k value by within cluster sum of  
square & record is grouping to which cluster group  
• Did Profiling using descriptive statistics to categorize the  
consumer's based on their preferences  
• Performed grouping of identified variables having same similar  
near data range & found out the centroid for each cluster  
Project Title: Employee Attrition Prediction  
Language: Python - SVM  
  
Description: An organization has manufacturing unit and employing around three
different functional areas. As on  
the last day of the year, the company had lost few productive employees. The
company would like to use this  
information and predict how many of the current employees would stay with the
organization in future.  
  
Responsibilities: -  
  
• Used Support vector machine Classification techniques where classify
employees by live and relieved  
• Performed some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning process to the
dataset and filling up missing value  
• Converted categorical column to numeric feature  
• Made model with basic parameters and evaluated by metrics  
• Improving model by using grid search method to find the best estimators for
the model's parameters  
• Validate the model by using multicollinearity, confusion matrix and
classification report  
  
Project Title: Iris Species Classification  
Language: Python - K-NN  
  
Description: The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a
multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in  
the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. The data set consists of
three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica  
and Iris versicolor) and four features were measured from each sample: the
length and the width of the sepals  
and petals, in centimeters.  
Responsibilities: -  
  
• The model is used to test classify iris flower species using K-Nearest
Neighbors Classification  
• We used to seaborn library to get the iris dataset  
• Performed some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning process to the
iris dataset  
• Splitting data into training/testing using Stratified random sampling  
• Improving model by using elbow method with error rate to found out K value  
• Perform model with found K-value and evaluated with confusion matrix and
classification report
