## Work Experience

Freelance Data Science Consulting and Learning Projects

-

March 2018 to Present

Key Projects and responsibilities:-  
  
Consulting a data science team for a matrimony site to build broom/bride
recommender.  
• The team had to build a recommender engine such that given data points of a
user profile what is the probability of that person selecting another person
for dating based on his/her education.  
• The team was facing the problem of class imbalance with multiple classes and
hence consulted them on how over sampling and ensemble can be useful in such
cases.  
• This technique helped them gain 86% metric score (AUC ROC) as compared to
75% with earlier models.  
  
Capstone Project for Mahindra First Choice:  
• Worked on huge and multiple datasets for the given vendor's data.  
• Developed strategies to merge and combine 3 different datasets.  
• Cleaned, preprocessed the dataset for data modelling.  
• Developed a recommender system for Mahindra First Choice for predictive
maintenance.  
  
Online Hackathon competition - Predict the criminal. - 10th Rank  
• The competition was to predict if a person is a criminal or not given
his/her various family and economic data points.  
• Only 6% of the total population in the data was guilty and hence it was
extremely important that the ML model captures and learns such a small portion
of the data.  
• A technique called oversampling with ensemble was used to train the model on
imbalanced data.  
• I was able to get a score of more than 84% on the online leader board which
put me under top 10 scores out of 13000 participants.  
  
Chat bot for service desk.  
• Created a Chabot for IT service desk to answer FAQs and simple resolution to
users' queries.  
• Used a library called Chatterbot to train the bot on user conversation with
a help desk agent.  
• Used Flask to develop an application that provides an UI for chat and
handles the model internally.  
• Hosted and initiated the bot on an AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance.  
  
Predicting if a company will bankrupt or not, given its various financial data
points.  
• This project included tasks like preprocessing the data, handling missing
data and outliers and finally having a brief understanding of the dataset.  
• Since understanding the data comes with domain knowledge, I used a Machine
Learning approach called 'feature_importance' with a Random Forest model to
select only the relevant features in the dataset.  
• An accuracy metric called AUC ROC score was used to evaluate the performance
of the model which essentially tell us how well separated our two classes are
(classes: Bankrupt or Not Bankrupt)  
• I achieved a descent score of 89% using this approach.  
  
PROJECTS ON GITHUB (https://github.com/riteshk28)  
  
• Designed and implemented Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict if
a user will churn from the bank or not.  
• Designed and implemented Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to perform
the task of image recognition.  
• Created an Adaptive Boosting machine learning model to predict credit card
defaulters.  
• Performed K-Means clustering on the above same dataset of credit card
default to evaluate the model's performance.  
• Created a NLP model for IT service management which can detect issue
category given its description without human intervention.  
• Packaging a complete machine learning pipeline into docker and deploying it
on AWS EC2 instance. (not on github)  
• Developed a service desk chatbot using Chatterbot
