As an intern I was responsible for presenting the findings obtained during
Exploratory Data Analysis, implementing the code for modelling, and prepare
necessary documentation and presentation.  
  
Projects  
1\. Internship projects  
  
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting of Retail Data  
• Analysis of retail data, examining trends, seasonality, missing data.  
• Stationarizing the data, using techniques such as - moving averages,
differences.  
• Predicting the time series, using ARIMA.  
• Tools used - Python, Jupyter Notebook  
  
POC on used car sales and finance data  
• Cleaning the data which included removing duplicates, correcting the format
of time and date data.  
• Exploratory Data Analysis.  
• Text Analysis, using Topic Modelling.  
• Preparing report.  
• Tools used - Python, Jupyter Notebook, MSSQL, MS Word, and MS PowerPoint.  
  
2\. MOOC Projects  
  
Machine Learning MOOC by Coursera  
• Implemented Linear Regression, Gradient Descent and Cost Function to predict
response variable using single and multiple independent variables  
• Implemented Logistic Regression, along with sigmoid function to classify
response variable using single and multiple  
independent variables.  
• Implemented Neural Networks to recognize hand-written digits.  
• Implemented Backpropagation algorithm to compute optimal parameters, for a
neural network.  
• Implemented Regularized Linear Regression and used it to study models with
different bias-variance properties.  
• Used Support Vector Machines to build a Spam Classifier.  
• Used K-means Clustering to compress an image.  
• Used Principal Component Analysis to find a low-dimensional representation
of face images.  
• Anomaly Detection Algorithm.  
• Used collaborative filtering to build recommender system.  
Problem Solving with Excel MOOC by Coursera  
• Basics of Excel navigation and functionality, including using formulas,
subtotals and text formatting.  
• Cleansing data using VLookup, value cleansing and text functions.  
• Use of logical functions such as COUNTIFS, SUMIFS, nested logical functions
and pivot tables.  
• Create statistical formulas, perform an index match, and build financial
formulas.  
Data Analysis with R MOOC by Udacity  
• Quantify and Visualize individual variables within a data set using
histograms, boxplots, transforms.  
• Techniques for exploring the relationship between any two variables in a
dataset, including scatterplots, lineplots, and correlations.  
• Techniques for examining relationship among multiple variables, such as,
plotting conditional summaries, bias-variance  
trade-offs, Scatterplot matrices, heat maps.  
• Using all techniques mentioned above to investigate Diamond dataset,
available in R.  
Data Wrangling with MongoDB by Udacity  
• Reading, writing and extracting relevant information from excel, csv, and
JSON files using Python modules such as  
XLRD, csv.  
• Scraping XML data using Python's BeautifulSoup and xml.etree.ElementTree
module.  
• Identifying various parameters for quality data and audit data for quality.  
• Queries to store data in MongoDB.  
• Creating sophisticated queries in MongoDB using pipelines and operators.
