## Work Experience

Solution Architect (Data Science & AI)

Maersk

-

Bengaluru, Karnataka

-

September 2017 to May 2018

Worked with a team of senior data scientists, data engineers and software
engineers to build Data Science products container optimization and cargo
damage prediction. Collected requirements from product owners and produced
system architecture documents.  
  
• Architected and designed micro-services based solution for creating
optimized load plans(for DAMCO), plans to fill shipping containers with cargo.
The solution uses Azure App Service for compute, Application/API Gateway for
security, Azure Active Directory/ Azure B2C for authentication and
authorization and Azure SQL DB for peristent storage.  
▪ Architected and designed business rule engine that enforces complex customer
rules during load plan creation.  
▪ Designed an approximation algorithm to allocate cargo to containers (based
on knapsack and reverse knapsack algorithms) and minimize the cost of load
plan.  
▪ Implemented business rule evaluation algorithm in Java.  
▪ Implemented UI to create/edit/delete business rules using Angular 4.  
  
• Architected and designed solution for predicting damage of perishable goods
in refrigerated containers during voyage. The solution uses Azure HDInsight
Spark cluster for processing Big Data, NoSQL Cosmos DB for persistent storage,
Azure Data Lake Store for storing Big Data, Azure App Service for compute,
Azure Active Directory for authentication and authorization and Azure Data
Factory for building data pipelines.  
▪ Defined data architecture. Defined data pipelines to process streaming IOT
data from containers in voyage(Remote Container Managment System) and to
predict cargo damage.  
▪ Defined data pipelines to automate the training/re-training of machine
learning models(logistic regression) used for predication of cargo damage.
