PROJECT DETAILS:  
Project Title: Mobile apps ranking  
Technology: Java, SQL  
Tools: MS - Office  
Duration: 6 Months  
Role: Developer  
Description: Ranking fraud in the mobile App market refers to fraudulent or
deceptive activities which have a purpose of bumping up the Apps in the
popularity list. Indeed, it becomes more and more frequent for App developers
to use shady means, such as inflating their Apps' sales or posting phony App
ratings, to commit ranking fraud. While the importance of preventing ranking
fraud has been widely recognized, there is limited understanding and research
in this area. To this end, in this paper, we provide a holistic view of
ranking fraud and propose a ranking fraud detection system for mobile Apps.
