## Publications

Recognize Indian Celebrities in Video

September 2018

1\. Parsed Indian Celebrities images.  
2\. Cleaned, detected faces and got the features(embeddings) of the face using
Facenet.  
3\. Built a model to find the most similar faces from the features of
celebrities.  
4\. Developed a pipeline to pass frames of video to the model and recognize
celebrities present in each frame  
5\. Model is scaled upto 30 celebrities.

Built deep Neural Network from scratch

September 2018

1.Built a deep neural network with 2 hidden layers for MNIST dataset to
predict images of handwritten numbers.  
2\. Generalised to RELU, Tanh, Sigmoid activation functions and number of
units in layer.  
3\. Used mini-batch gradient descent with momentum as hyper parameter to
accelerate the convergence and improve the optimization  
4\. Achieved 90% accuracy.

Multi-lingual News Recommender System

August 2018

Built a recommender system which recommends news articles. Returns diverse
articles for a first-time visitor, and personalised articles for repeat user.  
1\. Vectorised news corpus using various vectoriser models like tf-idf, topic
modelling, Glove, Word2Vec, Fast-Text.  
2\. Automated Clustering algorithm to find clusters within the news corpus.  
3\. Built a hybrid recommender system (content + collaborative based
filtering) to build user profile  
4\. Data is stored in Mongodb and scripting is done in python. REST APIs
exposed using Flask.

Bank Marketing using machine learning

July 2018

Goal of project-Predicting if the client will subscribe in a campaign or not  
1\. Preprocessed and made predictions in a highly skewed data set.  
2\. Used stacking to combine multiple models made on subsets of a large data
set  
3\. Accuracy achieved: 62%. The competition's(kaggle) winner was at 55%
