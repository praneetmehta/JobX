2) Title: Time Series Analysis  
  
Abstract: Forecast the earthquake tremors and frequency based on past data and
plot the result on graph.  
The goal in a time series analysis is often prediction. This is attained by
choosing and then fitting  
a good model for the time series. Models have, typically, three components:  
A trend component: is there a general upward/downward trend?  
A seasonal component: are there regular cycles to the data?  
A model for the correlation structure of the data  
This project contains data display of Magnitude average per day, Magnitude
rolling mean,  
Histogram and Magnitude forecasting.
