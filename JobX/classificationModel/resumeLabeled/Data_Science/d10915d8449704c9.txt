Autonomous Robot for 3D mapping and Object Detection

[https://github.com/kuntojirohan/autonomous-robot-for-switch-board-
detection](https://www.indeed.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkuntojirohan%2Fautonomous-
robot-for-switch-board-detection&h=094cd53c)

May 2018

This is a project wherein an autonomous robot is built which makes use of the
3D mapping technique to map the entire environment and finally is able to
navigate autonomously toward the detected switchboard within the environment.
This project is developed with the basic idea of making the robot to be able
to navigate toward the switchboard whenever it needs to be charged.
