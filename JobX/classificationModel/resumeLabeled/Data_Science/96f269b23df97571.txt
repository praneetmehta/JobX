September 2017 to Present

Did research and developed the complete business logic for heuri application
which is a heuristic application used for automating data science by building
R and python code for automating all machine learning and feed forward deep
learning algorithm, automl.  
>Did research and developed the data mining algorithms such as Apriori (Basket
analysis), imputation, Principal component Analysis.  
>Created network graph using Visnetwork to show the association between the
columnvalues in dataset.  
> Worked on building an animation loader which provides significant
visualization of the various stages involved during building the deep learning
model, the data that is processed at each stage and the performance metrics of
the built model. Also worked on the database design of the application and
building and populating the tables with relevant data.
