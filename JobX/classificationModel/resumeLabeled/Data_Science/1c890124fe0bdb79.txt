Academic Project:  
EAACK- an Intrusion detection system for MANET - (Secure computing using java)  
I was part of the project team and involved in Coding and Testing  
• Implementing the security for MANET  
• It is a ACKNOWLEDGEMENT based security to protect data sent in MANET
networks  
• Learned about MANET  
• Created the following mechanisms to detect and remove the affected regions
based on the hacking  
◦ ACK  
◦ SACK  
◦ MRA  
◦ DIGITAL SIGNATURE  
• The above security process is activated automatically in between source and
destination when the data is sent.  
• Applications  
◦ Detection of false misbehavior and blocking the region with immediate effect  
◦ Avoid loss of transmission  
◦ Encryption and Decryption only by sender and receiver using digital
signature  
• Testing  
◦ Prepared test plan and test cases  
◦ Wrote functional, integration and unit test cases  
◦ Reviewed the test against requirement specifications.  
◦ Test cases for this projects are,  
* Creation of multiple nodes.   
* Packet sent normally.   
* Packet sent after passive attack, SACK should be initialized.   
* Packet sent after active attack, MRA should sent packet to 3rd node only, not for 4th node.
