rate.  
• Category formation for better understanding of success rate.  
• Understanding the outliers to identify the defect arising from multiple
machines.  
• Implementation of KNN Model to find the defective machine.  
• Finding the optimum K value to get better accuracy.  
• Tools and Techniques: R, KNN, Outliers detection, Euclidean distance,
logistic regression.
