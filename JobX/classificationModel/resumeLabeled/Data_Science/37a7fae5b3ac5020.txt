AEDIFICO TECH PVT. LTD

April 2018 to Present

Support vector machine learn linear classifier from labelled training data to
predict labels of previously  
unseen test data. Kernal's with svm allows to learn non linear classifier and
hence lead to much higher  
classification accuracies in practice.  
  
• Have worked on non linear kernal combination to give us even better
classification accuracies and are  
seeing a possibility of a significant performance increase.  
  
• Have worked on project of finding a colorblindness of population of given
generation using numpy matrice and data visualisation of stock market in
different formats using pandas and tkinter.  
  
• Determined operational feasibility by evaluating analysis, problem
definition, requirements, solution  
developement and proposed solutions.A creative approach to problem solving.
