taking people are more likely proceed for surgery treatment pain management injections more likely spinal stenosis and sciatica are more likely for surgery follow visits are more likely proceed for surgery personal health device and healthcare cost objective the primary objective this study was understand there were any changes health care costs and utilization after members were given personal health device phd provided consulting services drive out and determine the analytics and research questions asked and then performed the analysis and drew conclusions what did the phd team provided list members along with the date each member started using the device the sba team linked these members administrative claims for these members determined there were any significant differences health care cost and utilization before and after they began using their devices four populations data were analyzed members who used their devices for least months months months and months results office visits increased for members who used the devices least months and for those who used them least months total costs increased for members after they used the devices least months the study then assessed how much the cost increases were due members engaging proactively their health care seeking more preventative services after they started using their phds increase the number preventive visits for members who used their devices for least months and increase for the months population addition the total cost preventive visits increased after least months wearing the devices conclusion these results suggest phd usage associated with members proactively using preventive health services exploratory analysis and trends for cancer cancer cost trends identify cancer diagnosed medical
